	 *
	 *   2.1.  Use of Retransmission Timers
	 *
	 *   Retransmissions of the IKE_SA_INIT request require some
	 *   special handling.  When a responder receives an
	 *   IKE_SA_INIT request, it has to determine whether the
	 *   packet is a retransmission belonging to an existing
	 *   "half-open" IKE SA (in which case the responder
	 *   retransmits the same response), or a new request (in
	 *   which case the responder creates a new IKE SA and sends a
	 *   fresh response), or it belongs to an existing IKE SA
	 *   where the IKE_AUTH request has been already received (in
	 *   which case the responder ignores it).
	 *
	 *   It is not sufficient to use the initiator's SPI and/or IP
	 *   address to differentiate between these three cases
	 *   because two different peers behind a single NAT could
	 *   choose the same initiator SPI.  Instead, a robust
	 *   responder will do the IKE SA lookup using the whole
	 *   packet, its hash, or the Ni payload.
	 *
	 * But realistically, either there's an IOT device sending out
	 * a hardwired SPIi, or there is a clash and a retry will
	 * generate a new conflicting SPIi.
	 *
	 * If the lookup succeeds then there are several
	 * possibilities:
	 *
	 * State has Message ID == 0:
	 *
	 * Either it really is a duplicate; or it's a second (fake?)
	 * initiator sending the same SPIi at exactly the same time as
	 * the first (wow, what are the odds, it must be our lucky
	 * day!).
	 *
	 * Either way, the duplicate code needs to compare packets and
	 * decide if a retransmit or drop is required.  If the second
	 * initiator is real, then it will timeout and then retry with
	 * a new SPIi.
	 *
	 * State has Message ID > 0:
	 *
	 * Either it is an old duplicate; or, again, it's a second
	 * initiator sending the same SPIi only slightly later (again,
	 * what are the odds!).
	 *
	 * Several choices: let the duplicate code drop the packet,
	 * which is correct for an old duplicate message; or ignore
	 * the existing state and create a new one, which is good for
	 * the second initiator but not so good for an old duplicate.
	 * Given an old duplicate is far more likely, handle that
	 * cleenly - let the duplicate code drop the packet.
