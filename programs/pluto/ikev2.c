 * IKEv2 has slightly different states than IKEv1.
 *
 * IKEv2 puts all the responsibility for retransmission on the end that
 * wants to do something, usually, that the initiator. (But, not always
 * the original initiator, of the responder decides it needs to rekey first)
 *
 * Each exchange has a bit that indicates if it is an Initiator message,
 * or if it is a response.  The Responder never retransmits its messages
 * except in response to an Initiator retransmission.
 *
 * The message ID is *NOT* used in the cryptographic state at all, but instead
 * serves the role of a sequence number.  This makes the state machine far
 * simpler, and there really are no exceptions.
 *
 * The upper level state machine is therefore much simpler.
 * The lower level takes care of retransmissions, and the upper layer state
 * machine just has to worry about whether it needs to go into cookie mode,
 * etc.
 *
 * Like IKEv1, IKEv2 can have multiple child SAs.  Like IKEv1, each one of
 * the child SAs ("Phase 2") will get their own state. Unlike IKEv1,
 * an implementation may negotiate multiple CHILD_SAs at the same time
 * using different MessageIDs.  This is enabled by an option (a notify)
 * that the responder sends to the initiator.  The initiator may only
 * do concurrent negotiations if it sees the notify.
 *
 * XXX This implementation does not support concurrency, but it shouldn't be
 *     that hard to do.  The most difficult part will be to map the message IDs
 *     to the right state. Some CHILD_SAs may take multiple round trips,
 *     and each one will have to be mapped to the same state.
 *
 * The IKEv2 state values are chosen from the same state space as IKEv1.

 *
 * XXX: A broken exception is when responding to an IKE_SA_INIT
 * request - the state machine calls the state transition function
 * with no state (trusting that the transition function will do the
 * job, but that isn't always true).  The fix is to create the state
 * before calling the state transition function (like is done for the
 * CHILD_SA code).
 *
 * Since, when initiating an exchange there is no message, code can't
 * assume that (*MDP) is non-NULL.
 *
 * XXX: Some state transition functions switch state part way (see
 * AUTH child code) and then tunnel the new state to this code via
 * (*MDP)->st and some callers passing in (*MDP)->st).  The fix is for
 * the AUTH code to handle the CHILD SA as a nested or separate
 * transition.
 *
 * XXX: The state transition structure (microcode) is stored in (*MDP)
 * forcing that structure to be created.  The fix is to store the
 * state's transition in the state.  As a bonus this makes determining
 * if a state is busy really really easy - if there's a
 * state-transition then it must be.
 *
 * This routine does not free (*MDP) (using md_delref(mdp)).
 * However, when suspending a state transition, it will save it in ST
 * and zap (*MDP) so that the caller can't free it.  Hence, the caller
 * must be prepared for (*MDP) being set to NULL.
 *
 * XXX: At some point (*MDP) was being used for:
 *
 * - find st
 * - success_v2_state_transition(st, md);
 *   - for svm:
 *     - svm->next_state,
