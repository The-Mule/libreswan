      Work around IKEv1 padding issues when inter-operating with other
      IKE daemons.

      By default, &Libreswan; pads messages
      to a minimum of 4-bytes.  While this is allowed it may cause
      interoperability issues.  To remove this padding, specify
      <option>ikepad=no</option> (note that this does not affect
      messages encrypted using a block-mode cipher where padding is
      always added).

      Prior to &Libreswan; version 5.2, some MODECFG payloads were
      incorrectly padded to 4-bytes which caused interoperability
      issues.  To restore this behaviour, specify
      <option>ikepad=yes</option>.
    </para>
    <para>
      In IKEv2, this option is ignored.

	Background
      </title>
      <para>
	It was thought that padding messages by 4-bytes was causing
	interoperability issues with
	&Checkpoint;
	(<option>ikepad=no</option> was added as a workaround).
	However, it's since been determined that &Racoon; also had
	interoperability issues and the cause was the padding of some
	XAUTH and MODECFG payloads.  Setting
	<option>ikepad=no</option> fixed interoperability because it
	was also disabling that padding.  The padding of XAUTH and
	MODECFG was removed in &Libreswan; version 5.2.

	Further details can be found in the RFCs, see: RFC-2409
	section 5.3, Phase 1 Authenticated With a Revised Mode of
	Public Key Encryption, <quote>the last byte of the padding
	contains the number of padding bytes</quote> and <quote>there
	will always be padding</quote>; RFC-2408 section 3.5, Proposal
	Payload, <quote>there is no padding applied to the payload,
	however, it can be applied at the end of the message</quote>;
	RFC-2408 section 3.6, Transform Payload, <quote>then
	subsequent payloads will not be aligned and any padding will
	be added at the end of the message to make the message 4-octet
	aligned</quote>.
