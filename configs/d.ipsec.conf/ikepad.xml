      IKE padding is allowed in IKEv1 but has been known to cause
      interoperability issues.  The ikepad= option can be used to
      disable IKEv1 padding.  This used to be required for some
      devices (such as Checkpoint in Aggressive Mode) that reject
      padded IKEv1 packets.  A bug was fixed in libreswan 3.25 that
      applied wrong IKE padding in XAUTH, so it is suspected that
      Checkpoint padding issue bas been resolved.  And this option
      should not be needed by anyone.

      In IKEv2, this option has no effect.
