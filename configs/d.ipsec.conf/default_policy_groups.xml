    The standard &Libreswan; install includes several policy groups
    which provide a way of classifying possible peers into IPsec
    security classes: <option>private</option> (talk encrypted only),
    <option>private-or-clear</option> (prefer encryption),
    <option>clear-or-private</option> (respond to requests for
    encryption), <option>clear</option> and <option>block</option>.
