      If set, the NFLOG group number to log this connection's
      pre-crypt and post-decrypt traffic to.  The default value of
      <option>0</option> means no logging at all.  This option is only
      available on linux kernel 2.6.14 and later.  It allows common
      network utilities such as tcpdump, wireshark and dumpcap, to use
      nflog:XXX pseudo interfaces where XXX is the nflog group
      number. During the updown phase of a connection, iptables will
      be used to add and remove the source/destination pair to the
      nflog group specified.  The rules are setup with the
      nflog-prefix matching the connection name. See also the global
      <option>nflog-all</option> option.
