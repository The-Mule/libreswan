      If pluto is instructed to log to a file using
      <option>logfile=</option>, this option determines whether the
      log file should be appended to or overwritten.  Valid options
      are <option>yes</option> (the default) to append and
      <option>no</option> to overwrite.  Since on modern systems,
      pluto is restarted by other daemons, such as systemd, this
      option should be left at its default <option>yes</option> value
      to preserve the log entries of previous runs of pluto.  This
      option is mainly of use for running the test suite, which needs
      to create new log files from scratch.

      Prior to &Libreswan; version 5.3 <command>pluto</command>, when
      invoked without a config file, had this option disabled.
