      Whether pluto should produce Linux Auditing System log messages.
      If enabled, pluto will log <option>start</option>,
      <command>stop</command> and <option>fail</option> for the
      negotiation of IKE and IPsec SA's.  The kernel will also log
      success and failures for actually adding and removing IPsec SA's
      from the kernel's SADB.  Valid options are
      <option>yes</option>(the default) and <option>no</option>.  On
      non-Linux systems, this option is ignored.  If enabled but the
      kernel is lacking audit support, audit messages are not sent.
      If the kernel has audit support and using it fails, pluto will
      abort.  Note that for compliance reasons, audit log messages
      contain the relevant IP addresses, even if
      <option>logip=no</option>.
