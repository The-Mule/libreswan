      The time in seconds until the acquire kernel state times out.
      On &Linux;, the default value, determined by
      <filename>/proc/sys/net/core/xfrm_acq_expires</filename> is 30
      seconds.  On BSD, this option is ignored.

    <para>
      On-demand connections (such as Opportunistic,
      <option>auto=ondemand</option>, or <command>ipsec
      route</command>) have an IPsec trap policy installed in the
      kernel.  If an outgoing (or inbound) packet matches this policy,
      a state is created in the kernel and then the kernel sends an
      ACQUIRE message to the IKE daemon pluto.  While this state is in
      place, no new acquires will come in for this connection.  The
      default should be fine for most people.  One use case of
      shortening these is if opportunistc encryption is used towards
      cloud instances that can quickly re-use IP addresses.
