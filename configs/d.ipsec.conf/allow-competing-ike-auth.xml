      Allow competing IKE_AUTH requests when both peers simultaneously
      initiate IKEv2 negotiations on the same connection. By default,
      when libreswan receives IKE_AUTH request from the peer while having
      an outstanding IKE_AUTH request, it responds with TEMPORARY_FAILURE
      to avoid potential SA mismatch issues. This option only applies to
      permanent IKEv2 connections so that the revival mechanism ensure
      connection retry.
