      How often to scan for Opportunistic Encryption failure shunts
      (kernel policies) that have expired and should be removed.
    </para>
    <para>
      When an Opportuistic Encryption negotiation fails, a failure
      shunt is installed to either block (<option>drop</option>) or
      allows(<option>pass</option>) traffic to the peer.  These shunts
      are given a lifetime of 15 minutes (see
      <option>shuntlifetime</option>) after which time they expire and
      should be removed.  The option
      <option>expire-shunt-interval</option> determines how frequently
      these shunts are checked.  The default interval is 20 seconds.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note: because these shunts (kernel policies) are not
      bound to a connection instance they are refered to as bare.
