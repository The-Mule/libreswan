    <para>
      Whether IDs should be considered identifying remote parties
      uniquely. Acceptable values are <option>yes</option> (the
      default) and <option>no</option>.  Participant IDs normally are
      unique, so a new connection instance using the same remote ID is
      almost invariably intended to replace an old existing
      connection.

    <para>
      When the connection is defined to be a server (using
      xauthserver=) and the connection policy is authby=secret, this
      option is ignored (as of 3.20) and old connections will never be
      replaced.  This situation is commonly known as clients using a
      "Group ID".

      This option may disappear in the near future. People using
      identical X.509 certificates on multiple devices are urged to
      upgrade to use separate certificates per client and device.

      Prior to &Libreswan; version 5.3, when <command>pluto</command>
      was started directly and without a configuration file, this
      option was set to <option>no</option>.
