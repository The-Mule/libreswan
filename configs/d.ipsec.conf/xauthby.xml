      When IKEv1 XAUTH support is available, set the method used by
      XAUTH to authenticate the user with IKEv1. The currently
      supported values are <option>file</option> (the default),
      <option>pam</option> or <option>alwaysok</option>.  The password
      file is located at <option>/etc/ipsec.d/passwd</option>, and
      follows a syntax similar to the Apache htpasswd file, except an
      additional connection name argument (and optional static IP
      address) are also present:

      For supported password hashing methods, see &crypt.3;.  If pluto
      is running in FIPS mode, some hash methods, such as MD5, might
      not be available. Threads are used to launch an xauth
      authentication helper for file as well as PAM methods.

      The <option>alwaysok</option> should only be used if the XAUTH
      user authentication is not really used, but is required for
      interoperability, as it defeats the whole point of XAUTH which
      is to rely on a secret only known by a human.  See also
