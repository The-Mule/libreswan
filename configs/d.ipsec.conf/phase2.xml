      Sets the type of SA that will be produced.  Valid options are:
      <option>esp</option> for encryption (the default),
      <option>ah</option> for authentication only.

      The very first IPsec designs called for use of AH plus ESP to
      offer authentication, integrity and confidentiality. That dual
      protocol use was a significant burden, so ESP was extended to
      offer all three services, and AH remained as an auth/integ. The
      old mode of <option>ah+esp</option> is no longer supported in
      compliance with RFC 8221 Section 4.  Additionally, AH does not
      play well with NATs, so it is strongly recommended to use ESP
      with the null cipher if you require unencrypted authenticated
      transport.
