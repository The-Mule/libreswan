One host connects and gets a lease IP on first connection.
subsequent connections sharing the IKE SA should use the
lease IP and not the left= as its leftsubnet policy

This test cannot easilly be expanded to show that north having
a conn with a subnet would work, as this will cause connection
switching issues on east as we don't have full responder code
for this. (if you try, you will find other conns start failing)
