test a very distracted IKE_SESSION_RESUME

EAST has three connections:

- distraction

  -> matches IKE_SA_INIT

  -> should not match IKE_SESSION_RESUME as that requires
     session-resumption=yes

- resume-distraction

  -> matches IKE_SA_INIT (except DISTRACTION above matches first)

  -> matches IKE_SESSION_RESUME as has required session-resumption=yes

- any-east

  both of above should switch to this during IKE_AUTH

Hence:

- initial connection

  - during IKE_SA_INIT instantiates DISTRACTION
  - during IKE_AUTH switches to and instantiates ANY-EAST

- session resume

  - during IKE_SESSION_RESUME instantiates RESUME-DISTRACTION
  - during IKE_AUTH switches to and instantiates ANY-EAST
