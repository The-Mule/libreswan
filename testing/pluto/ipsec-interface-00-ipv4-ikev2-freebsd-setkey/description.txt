FreeBSD with ipsec-interface

On FreeBSD with if_ipsec(4):

- create ipsec1 with msgid
- add tunnel describing ESP
- add inet describing what is tunneled

The tunnel adds kernel policies bound to the ipsec interface and
direct it to the kernel state using a message ID.

Generated kernel state then needs to match.
