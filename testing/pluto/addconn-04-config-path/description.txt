Testing of non-standard ipsec.conf passed to pluto

Fixed in 3.30:

- PLUTO, was always passing the default "ipsec.conf" path to ADDCONN.

  This meant that when given a config file containing connections, and
  in a non-standard location, vis:

    --config /notetc/ipsec.conf

  The file was ignored by ADDCONN, and any connections it contains
  were never loaded.

- also, `ipsec status` would display the default "ipsec.conf" path
  instead of the non-standard path specified by pluto

Fixed in 5.4:

- PLUTO, was passing the unresolved path to ADDCONN.  This meant that
  when given a relative path like:

    --config ipsec.conf

  ADDCON, since it is run under PLUTO and in a system directory, could
  typically not load the file.
