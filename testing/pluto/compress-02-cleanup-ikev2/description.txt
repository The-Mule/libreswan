IKEv2 test using IPCOMP

Test to see if the ipcomp state is properly deleted when the connection goes down.
eg:

src 192.1.2.23 dst 192.1.2.45
	proto comp spi 0x0000a833 reqid 16390 mode tunnel
	replay-window 0 flag af-unspec
	comp deflate 
	anti-replay context: seq 0x0, oseq 0x0, bitmap 0x00000000
src 192.1.2.23 dst 192.1.2.45
	proto 4 spi 0xc0010217 reqid 0 mode tunnel
	replay-window 0 flag af-unspec
	anti-replay context: seq 0x0, oseq 0x0, bitmap 0x00000000

These states were not cleaned up in libreswan up to 4.9
