Test RFC 4945 PKI Profile for IKE/ISAKMP/PKIX's Key Usage

See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4945#section-5.1.3.2

   A summary of the logic flow for peer cert validation follows:

   o  If no KU extension, continue.

   o  If KU present and doesn't mention digitalSignature or
      nonRepudiation (both, in addition to other KUs, is also fine),
      reject cert.

   o  If none of the above, continue.

this tests:

  west-ku-missing                        establish
  west-ku-nonRepudiation                 establish
  west-ku-digitalSignature               establish
  west-ku-digitalSignature-certSigning   establish
  west-ku-certSigning                    reject

Note: the basic certs all have KU=digitalSignature so the test with
west-ku-digitalSignature is redundant.
