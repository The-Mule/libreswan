Test RFC 4945 PKI Profile for IKE/ISAKMP/PKIX's Basic Constraints

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4945#section-5.1.3.9
5.1.3.9.  BasicConstraints

   The PKIX certificate profile mandates that CA certificates contain
   this extension and that it be marked critical.  IKE implementations
   SHOULD reject CA certificates that do not contain this extension.
   For backwards compatibility, implementations may accept such
   certificates if explicitly configured to do so, but the default for
   this setting MUST be to reject such certificates.

Which is a bit vague.

It's interpreted as intermediate and root certs both need CA=y (and
preferably critical).  But critical doesn't really matter as NSS
supports Basic Constraints.

To that end, the following end certs should all work:

  - west-bc-missing (end cert)

    it's included for completeness - the basic end certs already omit
    the Basic Constraint

  - west-bc-n (on end cert)
  - west-bc-n-critical (on end cert)

While a chain, where the intermediate sent over the wire does not have
the Basic Constraint CA=y, should fail (which it does):

   - west-bc-missing-chain-int (included)
   - west-bc-missing-chain-end (auth)
