ikev1 Main+ModeCFG:SET+Quick

- server skips XAUTH
- server initiates MODECFG set

this means the server goes straight from receiving Main's final
request to initiating a MODECFG set message.

That message needs to use the IV from the most recent decrypt (i.e.,
the final Phase 1 IV) else the peer can't decrypt it.
