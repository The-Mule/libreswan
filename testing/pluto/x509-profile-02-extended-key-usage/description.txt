Test RFC 4945 PKI Profile for IKE/ISAKMP/PKIX's Extended Key Usage

See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4945#section-5.1.3.12

   Implementations that do support EKU MUST support the following
   logic for certificate validation:

   o  If no EKU extension, continue.

   o  If EKU present AND contains either id-kp-ipsecIKE or
      anyExtendedKeyUsage, continue.

   o  Otherwise, reject cert.

this tests:

  west-eku-missing                      establish
  west-eku-anyExtendedKeyUsage          establish
  west-eku-ipsecIKE			establish
  west-eku-serverAuth			requires config
  west-eku-clientAuth			requires config
  west-eku-codeSigning			reject
  west-eku-ipsecIKE-codeSigning		establish

Note: the basic certs all have no EKU so the test with
west-eku-missing is redundant
