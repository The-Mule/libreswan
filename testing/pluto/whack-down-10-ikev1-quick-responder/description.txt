IKEv1 quick exchange where the half quick connection is deleted

The responder receives the quick-mode message, transitions, and then
responds.  The connection is then unrouted.  The last transition
being:

  routing: stop ESTABLISH_INBOUND, UNROUTED_BARE_NEGOTIATION->UNROUTED_INBOUND, PERMANENT; ok=yes; negotiating_ike_sa #1 established_ike_sa #1 newest_routing_sa #0->#2

This happens when the initiator disappears part way through the quick
exchange.
