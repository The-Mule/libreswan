Usage:

    $0 <summarydir> <rutdir> <earliest_commit> 

Iterate through [<earliest_commit>..HEAD] identifying the next next commit
to test.

On STDOUT, print the hash of the next commit to test.  The first of
the following is chosen:

  - <earliest_commit>, presumably it was specified for a reason

  - HEAD

  - a tag

  - a branch/merge point

  - when HEAD is "uninteresting", the most recent "interesting" commit

  - some other "interesting" commit selected by splitting the longest
    run of untested commits

On STDERR, in addition to random debug lines, list the status of all
commits using the format:

    {TESTED,UNTESTED}: <resultdir> <hash> <interesting> <index> <run-length> <bias>

(see git-interesting.sh for <interesting>'s value)
(see earliest-commit.sh for <earliest_commit>'s value)
