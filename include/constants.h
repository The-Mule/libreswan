 * zero an object given a pointer to it.
 *
 * Note: this won't work on a pointer to the first element of an
 * array since sizeof() will only give the length of the first element.
 * Unfortunately, no compiler diagnostic will flag this.
 * Any array will have to be prefixed with an & to yield a pointer
 * to the whole array.  The normal representation for a string or pointer
 * to a raw buffer is a pointer to the first element, so they cannot be zeroed.
 *
 * Simple form of this rule:
 * The argument to zero must be prefixed by & unless it is a pointer
 * to the object you wish to zero.  A pointer to an object must be
 * a pointer to the whole object, not just the first element.
 *
 * Note also that zeroing a pointer is not guaranteed to make it NULL
 * (read the C standard).  This problem is mostly theoretical since
 * on almost all real architectures it works.
 * ??? there are many calls that are intended to set pointers to NULL.
 * ??? there are many calls to zero that are not needed and thus confusing.
 *     Often we would be better served if calls to messup were used:
 *     actual bugs might be detected.
